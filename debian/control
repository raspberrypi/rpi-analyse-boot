Description: Boot analysis service for Raspberry Pi systems
 rpi-analyse-boot is a system service that gathers boot-up performance
 information and collates it into a single HTML report shortly after boot.
 .
 The service uses a variety of information sources including data generated by
 systemd-analyze, rpi-trace-boot.service (if available), and Pressure Stall
 Information (PSI) statistics to provide comprehensive insights into boot
 performance and resource contention during the boot process.
 .
 The generated report is saved as /run/rpi-analyse-boot.service/index.html
 and includes bootchart visualisation, critical path analysis, and system
 information specific to Raspberry Pi hardware.
